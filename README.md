So you clone the repo

then npm install the node-modules and such and then run dev

## Creating a project

Yet without acces to my supabase evironment that will be challenge.

For now visit pexos.netlify.app to get to know the tool if you would like to use it.

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Everything inside `src/lib` is part of your library, everything inside `src/routes` can be used as a showcase or preview app.

## Building

To build your library:

```bash
npm run package
```

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Publishing

Go into the `package.json` and give your package the desired name through the `"name"` option. Also consider adding a `"license"` field and point it to a `LICENSE` file which you can create from a template (one popular option is the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)).

To publish your library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm publish
```
